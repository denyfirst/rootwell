# Security invariants

An invariant is a behavior Rootwell must preserve, not an aspiration. Every
entry names tests that exist. A change that renames or removes a cited test must
update this file in the same commit, and CI verifies that the citations resolve.

This initial list guards the CLI boundary. Parser, file-writing, and
cryptographic invariants are added with the code that first creates those
risks.

## C1 — Diagnostics do not reflect command input

Unknown commands and invalid argument combinations are attacker-controlled and
may contain paths, credentials, terminal escapes, or private data. Diagnostics
state what was wrong without repeating the supplied token.

Guarded by `TestUnknownCommandDoesNotEchoInput` and `FuzzRun`.

## C2 — Exit codes and output channels are stable

Success is `0`, operational failure is `1`, and command-line usage failure is
`2`. Requested information goes to stdout; diagnostics and usage failures go to
stderr. Automation must not infer success from text.

Guarded by `TestRunContract`.

## C3 — Output failure cannot be reported as success

A closed pipe, full filesystem, or failed writer is an operation failure. Help
or version output that was not delivered must not return success.

Guarded by `TestRunReportsWriteFailure`.

## C4 — Build version output is a single safe line

Build metadata is part of the release boundary. It cannot inject additional
terminal lines or control characters into output; invalid injected metadata is
reported as `development` rather than reproduced.

Guarded by `TestVersionValue` and `FuzzVersionValue`.
